# Conduit Test Automation - (API & Web)

[CI/CD Workflow](https://github.com/bruno-rcn/ConduitApiWeb-Aut/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
[![Test Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Test_Report-View_Online-28a745?style=for-the-badge)](https://bruno-rcn.github.io/ConduitApiWeb-Aut/)

An end-to-end test automation framework for the [Conduit (RealWorld App)](https://demo.realworld.io/) application, covering both front-end (Web UI) and back-end (API) tests.

---

## 📜 About the Project

This project was developed to automate the validation of the "Conduit" application, an exemplary clone of Medium.com that serves as a reference application for demonstrating full-stack frameworks.

The goal of this automation framework is to ensure the quality and stability of the application's critical features, both on the back-end (via API tests) and the front-end (via user interface tests).

The project's architecture follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for the UI tests, ensuring that the code is reusable, readable, and easy to maintain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended, e.g., v20.x or higher)
* NPM (usually installed with Node.js)

### 📦 Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bruno-rcn/ConduitApiWeb-Aut.git](https://github.com/bruno-rcn/ConduitApiWeb-Aut.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ConduitApiWeb-Aut
    ```

3.  Install all project dependencies. The `npm ci` command is recommended to ensure a clean and consistent installation based on the `package-lock.json` file.
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

4.  Playwright needs to install the browsers it uses for testing. Run the command below to install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    ```

### ▶️ Running the Tests

You can run the tests in different ways, depending on your needs.

#### Run all tests in Headless mode (command line)

This is the default mode, ideal for running in CI/CD pipelines.
```bash
npx playwright test
```

#### Run tests with the Playwright UI

This command opens a graphical interface that allows you to debug tests, see each step of the execution, and interactively explore locators.
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

#### Run a specific test file

To focus on a specific scenario, you can pass the path to the test file.
```bash
npx playwright test tests/api.spec.ts
```

## 📊 Reports

After the tests run, two types of reports are generated.

### Allure Report (Published on GitHub Pages)

A complete and interactive report with an execution history is automatically generated and published with every run on GitHub Actions.

**[Click here to access the online report](https://bruno-rcn.github.io/ConduitApiWeb-Aut/)** (or click the badge at the top of this README).

### Local Playwright Report

For a quick local analysis, you can view the HTML report generated by Playwright from the last run.
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
This command will open the report in your default browser.
